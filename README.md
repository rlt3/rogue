Another Roguelike!
================

### Who doesn't like roguelikes?

After trying to make one, I sure don't!

Ah, who am I kidding? Trying to make something only makes you love it more. After wanting to try and make games for forever, I finally decided to learn how by making a traditional console roguelike (with text characters). But we're in the future now and I wanted graphics!

And graphics are really hard to do!

So mostly I mess around trying to understand (and failing) how state machines work, but it's all in good fun.

### How can I run it?


There isn't much to see other than a player character and a monster here or there, depending on which commit you're looking at. But if you really want to, read on:

I'm developing this currently on a Macbook Air, 10.7.2. If you're on an Intel Macbook, just clone the repository and get SDL and use the Makefile I have. If you're on a *nix system, get the SDL library and compile with that (I think you won't need the SDL_main.h and .m included in this repository).

Otherwise wait until it is finished!
