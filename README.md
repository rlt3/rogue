Another Roguelike!
================

### But not really!

A long, long time ago, when I first started this project, I figured I'd make a Roguelike. Having played Nethack a lot, I went down that route.

The game was started from a terminal and played from a terminal. I had a bunch of cool stuff: There were goblins and dragons. There was a win state and a lose state and it was fairly sophisticated, coding wise.

For me, at least. I'd never coded a game before. But then I showed it to someone and they said "Why don't you have graphics?" The answer I had was "Because I don't know how to do that." That's not a good answer.

So, I've been using the SDL library to do graphics. That means I have to focus on a smaller things, like animations, collisions, etc. Adding graphics makes things a lot more complicated. My game hasn't 'caught up' to where I had it, when it was still just terminal based.

### How do I play it?

There really isn't much to do in the game at the moment, but if you really want to try it, you are going to need the SDL library on your machine.

I am building this on Mac OSX 10.7.2 with GCC 4.2.1. 

Use the Makefile provided and the editor of your choice. I haven't tried compiling this on Windows and I doubt it would work there at all.

If you can't figured out how to do all of that, wait until it is finished!
