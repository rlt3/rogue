/*
 * Our entities are all of our `living' things that move around in the game.
 *
 * There is a list of Entity Pointers that get manipulated as they walk, move,
 * or attack. The reason I used a list of Entity pointers (rather than just a
 * list of Entities) is that we need to do pointer comparison at points.
 *
 * So, when an entity attacks, it loops through all of the entities to see if
 * it hit anyone of them. An entitiy that attacked would almost certainly `hit
 * itself' if we didn't have pointer comparison.
 *
 * The same goes for movement and collision. 
 *
 * We also need to use a list of Entity Pointers because the player character
 * needs to be tracked at all times while in the list. The list gets sorted and
 * the positions of the entities inside are not static. Therefore, being able
 * to update the player independently from the rest of the entities (while
 * still being inside the list), requires the list to have pointers. This all
 * hinges on me not knowing a better way to do this.
